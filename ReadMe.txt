# Digital Thermostat Implementation

## Overview

This project is an embedded system simulation of a digital thermostat implemented in C/C++. The system includes temperature simulation, user interaction, control logic, and feedback mechanisms to maintain the temperature close to the desired setting.

## Code Organization

The source code is organized into several modules to ensure readability, maintainability, and extensibility:

- **dht11.h**: Header file for the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor.
- **LiquidCrystal_I2C.h**: Header file for the LiquidCrystal_I2C library for interfacing with the LCD.
- **main.cpp**: Main application file containing the setup and loop functions.
- **README.md**: Documentation file providing information on the project.

## Temperature Simulation

The temperature simulation is achieved through the DHT11 sensor readings. While the actual hardware is not available for simulation, random values within a specified range or a simple algorithm can be used to simulate temperature variations.

## User Interaction

The user interface allows the user to set the desired temperature and observe current temperature readings. This is implemented through the LCD display. While physical buttons are not present in this simulation, the concept can be extended to include hardware buttons for temperature adjustments in a real-world scenario.

## Control Logic

The control algorithm adjusts a virtual heating or cooling system based on simulated temperature readings and the desired temperature set by the user. The goal is to maintain the temperature as close to the desired setting as possible.

## Feedback and Display

The LCD display provides visual feedback, indicating the current temperature, desired temperature, and the state of the heating or cooling system (on/off). This feedback mechanism is crucial for users to monitor and control the system effectively.

## Building and Running the Simulation

To build and run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (DHT11 and LiquidCrystal_I2C).
2. Set up your development environment (Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, etc.).
3. Upload the code to your target platform.

## Optional: Unit Testing

If you have experience with unit testing, you can include a suite of unit tests to verify the correctness of your implementation. This step is optional but highly recommended for ensuring the robustness of the system.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your implementation will be evaluated based on:

- Correctness: The system accurately simulates temperature readings and adjusts the virtual heating or cooling system.
- Code Quality: The code is well-structured, readable, and follows best practices for embedded systems development.
- Modularity and Reusability: The code is modular and reusable for easy modification or extension.
- User Interface: The interface is intuitive, providing necessary functionality for temperature control and observation.
- Documentation: The README file provides clear instructions and explanations for building and running the simulation.
